# React-Clicky-Game

**React-Clicky-Game** is a memory game that renders 12 different images to the screen. The game keeps track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if the player clicks the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
